title: Biometric FIDO Authentication
---

Partners interested in using biometric authentication for NHS login, will need a FIDO client that works with our FIDO server.

[NHS client code for Android](https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhsapp-fido-client-android)

[NHS client code for iOS](https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhsapp-fido-client-ios)

Partners can use this code to install their own client or reference it to create their own FIDO client.

You can find out more about our use of FIDO by reading the [external interface specification](https://nhsconnect.github.io/nhslogin/interface-spec-doc/) (EIS).
