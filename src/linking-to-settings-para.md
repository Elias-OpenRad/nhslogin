 NHS login provides capability for users to change their NHS login settings online, helping to reduce support overheads. 

  ## NHS login currently allows users to:

- change their email address
- change their password
- change their mobile phone number
- delete their NHS login
 To help users do this, NHS login needs you to create a link from your service to the [NHS login settings page](https://settings.login.nhs.uk). 
 
 Use [this slide deck](https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhslogin/raw/master/NHSlogin%20Link%20to%20Settings%20Page%20v1.0.pptx) for guidance on implementing this.
 
 N.B. We are currently in the process of moving the content from the PowerPoint deck to this site.
