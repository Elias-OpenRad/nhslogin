title: Sharing a user's NHS login information with your service
---

Users need to agree to share their NHS login information with the partner service to access the service.

If a user does not agree to share their NHS login information, the partner service will need to display a clear message telling them they will be unable to use the service.


## How to place this message on your service 

To ensure consistency across partner services we have created an example page for you to use in your service.

The “go back to NHS login” link in the body text should return the user to the consent page on NHS login. This allows users to agree to share their information without having to restart the log in process.
