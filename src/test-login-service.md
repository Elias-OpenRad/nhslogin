title: How can I test NHS login in my service?
---

 There is a mock and a sandpit that development teams can use to familiarise themselves with NHS login.

 ## NHS login mock

 We have developed a lightweight mock that is a representation of our OIDC endpoints. The mock is entirely self-service and requires no registration. You can find out more about the mock and access it here: [https://oidc.mock.signin.nhs.uk/client](https://oidc.mock.signin.nhs.uk/client). 

 ## Sandpit
 
 Our sandpit is a deployment of much of the production code, with some elements of the registration process removed e.g. matching to NHS number and checking ID documents. You can find out how to integrate to the sandpit in the next section.
